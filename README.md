If you are not familiar with coding, spread the word! I'd love it to be helpful to more people. If you got some idea, make an issue about it.

If you know some coding, welcome! Please consider using the latest packages and writing standard to keep debt to a minimum. Small cosmetic improvements and translations are also very welcome.

If you want to make a new feature or do a total design change, consider making a feature request before starting work on it to avoid unhappy faces down the line.
